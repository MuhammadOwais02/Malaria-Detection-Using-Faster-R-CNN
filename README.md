# Malaria Detection Using Faster R-CNN

This repository contains the code and resources for the Malaria Detection project using Faster R-CNN. The project involves preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and model prediction.

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect malaria from blood smear images using Faster R-CNN. The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and prediction.

## Project Overview
### Goals
- Preprocess blood smear images for analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
- Train a Faster R-CNN model for malaria detection.
- Evaluate the model and make predictions on new data.

### Features
- Comprehensive preprocessing and data cleaning.
- Detailed EDA to gain insights into the dataset.
- Implementation of Faster R-CNN for object detection.
- Model evaluation and prediction capabilities.
